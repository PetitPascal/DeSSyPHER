# SurvBioHAP: Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Human Biomonitoring tool


üåç **Available languages:** [Fran√ßais](README_fr.md) | [English](README.md)

- **Goal**

The PAH HBM tool supports the interpretation and decision-making process regarding 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP) concentrations, by providing relevant contextual and analytical information.

The results generated by the tool are valid only for the exposure scenario and parameters defined by the user, within the limits and uncertainties of the available data (e.g., literature data) and methods 
applied. The responsibility for selecting the most relevant total pyrene/benzo[a]pyrene (PyrT/BaP) ratio, parameters, and exposure scenario rests with the user. 
SurvBioHAP is an educational French version of PAH HBM Tool, for students, practitioners, and public health professionals (e.g., occupational physicians).

The interface is organized into a blue box panel (parameters) and nine tabs.

- **Strenghts**

SurvBioHAP allows the user to calculate an indicative biological limit value based on the recommendation of ACGIH and a defined exposure scenario. SurvBioHAP also allows the user to estimate the 
probability of exceeding the estimated indicative biological limit value. The PAH HBM tool can provide consistency and support direct comparisons between studies and countries to help in the establishment of 
appropriate safe pollutant guidelines.

SurvBioHAP incorporates a variety of features to make it easy to use. Beyond making the interpretation of 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP) urinary levels easier, this tool offers the chance to have an 
immediate glimpse into the results and to see how the results change according to different setting configurations.

In addition to making information more readily understood and retained in a quicker time, the visual aids and representations provided by SurvBioHAP could be useful for improving results 
communication and promoting transparency among studies when conducting interpreting 1-hydroxypyrene urinary levels.

Periodic updates of the SurvBioHAP will allow for the integration of updated and new data as well as new functionalities.

Help buttons are displayed throughout the entire tool to provide help and insights for using or setting parameters, reading graphs and interacting with graphs and tables.

SurvBioHAP is intended for occupational physicians, researchers, risk managers, practitioners, authoritative bodies, decision-makers or anyone who wishes to interpret 1-hydroxypyrene urinary levels.


- **Limitations**

It can take from a few seconds to a few minutes to generate all the graphs and tables, depending on the number of simulation runs chosen, your internet connection and your computer power.

The results generated with SurvBioHAP are only valid for the exposure scenario and parameters defined by the user within the limits and uncertainties associated with the data (e.g. data from the 
literature) and methods used. A detailed discussion of the strengths and limitations of the PAH HBM tool is available elsewhere (Clauzel et al. 2024).

The choice of the most relevant or legitimate total pyrene/benzo[a]pyrene ratio, parameters and exposure scenario to use falls to the responsibility of the individual using this tool. In addition, 
available information is updated regularly in SurvBioHAP (at least once every year) but might not be complete or up-to-date at the time of use.

There is no interpretation made, the tool can only help the user interpret her, his or their results. Therefore, it falls on the user to interpret the results provided by this tool accordingly.

‚ö† By using SurvBioHAP you acknowledge that you fully understand the goals, principles and limitations of this tool and that you cannot hold the authors of this tool responsible for the interpretation of 
your analysis.


- **Information regarding interactivity**

All graphs and figures are interactive. When hovering over a figure, additional information appears on screen over the data point and on the top-right of the graph, where small icons are displayed.

When hovering over a data point, a label with information regarding this point appears.

When there is a legend displayed, it is possible to remove some data points by clicking on the data you want to remove. Clicking back makes the data reappear.

Each icon represents a functionality such as downloading the graph (camera icon) or zooming in.

All the tables are interactive, with the possibility of making queries (in each column or in the whole table), selecting the column to display, 
or exporting the table with the different buttons available. It is also possible to change the column order by dragging each column. 
For exporting the entire table, you need to first click on the number of rows to display button, then choose the *All* option and finally click on one export or download button.

- **File upload instructions**

To upload a file, click Import dataset. A pop-up window will appear, allowing you to select the file you wish to upload.

After selecting your file, click the gear icon to adjust the decimal separator if necessary. It is strongly recommended to use a dot (.) as the decimal separator ‚Äî otherwise, numeric values may be misinterpreted and could cause the application to crash.

Use the View tab to preview the dataset and verify that the data has been read correctly. The Update tab allows you to make modifications to the dataset; don‚Äôt forget to click Apply changes to confirm them.

When ready, click Import data to finalize the upload. Once the file has been successfully imported, the button label will change to File uploaded. You can click it again at any time to upload a new file.


- **User guide**

Help buttons are available throughout the tool. They provide guidance for setting parameters, reading graphs, and interacting with tables and figures.  
The blue box panel (left side of the interface) is used to define the exposure scenario. The *Run new analysis* button applies any changes made in the parameter box. Results will update only after clicking this 
button. 
‚ö† Depending on the number of simulation runs, internet connection, and computer performance, generating results may take from a few seconds to several minutes.

Users begin by defining an occupational context:

-Country

-Similar exposure group (SEG): sector, process/post, activity

To view the full list of available options, click the dropdown menus (white area or black arrow).

***Definitions***:

-*Sector*: Industry or product/raw material type.

-*Process*: Location or operation with distinct emission sources.

-*Activity*: Task or series of tasks.

***Data source***:

Users may choose between:

-Published literature data,

-The Exporisq-HAP dataset,

-Or both (if available).

‚ö† Only one option can be selected at a time.

‚ö† If you upload your own concentration file, this section is ignored.

Users can include the effect of respiratory protective equipment (RPE) in their analysis. Efficiency is applied via an assigned protection factor (APF). Examples: A particulate mask 
(APF = 10 for particulate PAHs, APF = 1 for gaseous PAHs) reduces particulate PAHs by 90% while leaving gaseous PAHs unchanged.

Nine tabs are displayed at the top of the interface. The active tab is highlighted (dark blue background, bold font). 

The *R√©sultats* tab displays:

-The estimated BGV (ACGIH method), based on the chosen scenario.

-Distribution of 1-OHP concentrations (adjusted by PyrT/BaP ratio).

-Probability of exceeding the estimated BGV.

***Outputs***:

-Table 1: Airborne PAH ratios and estimated BGVs.

-Figure 1: Distribution of urinary 1-OHP by occupational context, shown as boxplots + violin plots. Geometric mean and 95% CI are displayed.

-Table 2: Summary of distribution parameters and BGV exceedance probabilities.

‚ö† Hovering over Figure 1 shows log-transformed values. To recover non-log values, compute 10^(‚àídisplayed value).

If both 1-OHP and airborne PAH files (‚â• 3 contexts) are uploaded, a matrix of degrees of agreement is generated. Each cell shows % overlap between distributions (0% = no overlap, 100% = complete overlap). 

***Other tabs***:

-*Donn√©es de la litt√©rature*: Inventory of PyrT/BaP ratios from literature and Exporisq-HAP dataset.

-*EPI*: Table of APF values from literature. 

-*Valeurs limites*: Table of airborne BaP and urinary 1-OHP limits.

-*Actualit√©s*: Publications describing or citing the PAH HBM tool.

-*Guide d'utilisation*: General tool information, strengths/limitations, interactivity guidance, privacy/legal details, and bug reporting.

-*Contact*: Contact information.

-*Mentions l√©gales*: Legal notices.
